In QuickCheck, you specify properties of your code that should hold regardless of input. QuickCheck then randomly generates the input data to try to find a case for which the property fails. When such a case is found, it tries to find a minimal test case by shrinking the input data. This minimal test case is then reported for easy reproduction. This form of testing became known as property based testing and is actually the dominant form of testing in the Haskell ecosystem. Fascinated by the concept and surprised that nobody had made a worthy alternative for C++, I decided to create RapidCheck. RapidCheck is a complete implementation of property based testing for C++11 that implements all of the significant features of the original Haskell version and even more.

Essentially the steps are as follows: decide on a number of buckets (B).

Once the hash map is established, all sampling is performed on the bucket level. This implies that a bucket either is or is not in a sample at any given time point. If we want to sample N number of users, we sample the number of buckets that contain the number of users closest to the desired number N. If, e.g., the desired N is 20 and each bucket contains 3 users, we would sample 7 buckets and end up with 21 users.

A program of exclusive experiments is a set of experiments run over time where all simultaneous experiments are exclusive to each other. That is, a unit is in at most one, and only one, of the experiments in the program at any given time point. At Spotify we have such programs for several surfaces in the app, for example Search, the Home screen, and certain parts of the backend code base. To better understand the limitations imposed on the sampling by running programs of exclusive experiments, it is helpful to introduce the concepts of paths. A path is simply a sequence of experiments that a unit can be in. Figure 3 illustrates a program of exclusive experiments containing 5 experiments over time. Below the experiments, their possible paths are displayed. For example, it is not possible to go through both Experiments 3 and 4 as they overlap in time and are exclusive, and must therefore be run on distinct users. The number of unique possible paths explodes combinatorially after a relatively short time period in most programs, and only a small partition of the possible paths can be taken by any unit regardless of the sample strategies discussed in this post.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{"target":{"metadata":{"tags":[],"concepts":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"p762jor363g1"}},"id":"assetwrapper_5e0eb704595639eac529ee4491c21bf0","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2025-03-13T14:11:35.680Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-13T14:11:35.680Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"spotify-engineering","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"publishedVersion":2,"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assetWrapper"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Paths of experiences","asset":{"metadata":{"tags":[],"concepts":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"p762jor363g1"}},"id":"attachment_a17772f6a658786a7032c594a27aeb9e","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2025-03-13T13:12:57.332Z","updatedAt":"2025-03-13T13:12:57.332Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"spotify-engineering","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"publishedVersion":3,"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Paths of experiences","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/p762jor363g1/attachment_a17772f6a658786a7032c594a27aeb9e/47da70d6766d4af2b4ab8d35a6968518/attachment_a17772f6a658786a7032c594a27aeb9e.png","details":{"size":330354,"image":{"width":1370,"height":1578}},"fileName":"attachment_a17772f6a658786a7032c594a27aeb9e.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"caption":{"nodeType":"document","data":{},"content":[{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Figure 3:\n","marks":[],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"text","value":"Paths of experiences possible during a hypothetical program of 5 exclusive experiments.","marks":[{"type":"italic"}],"data":{}}],"data":{}}]},"alt":null,"width":"700","height":"806","type":"image","alignment":"left","raw_html":"<img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4426\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"806\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-250x288.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-768x885.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-1334x1536.png 1334w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-120x138.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3.png 1370w\" width=\"700\"/>","html_attributes":{"loading":"lazy","decoding":"async","width":"700","height":"806","src":"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png","alt":"","class":["wp-image-4426"],"srcset":"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-250x288.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-768x885.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-1334x1536.png 1334w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3-120x138.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2021/03/Figure3.png 1370w","sizes":"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}},"content":[],"nodeType":"embedded-entry-block"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Highlights from ","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89906-6_50"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Schultzberg et al.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"}],"nodeType":"heading-2"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Schultzberg et al. presents two key results:","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"Under unrestricted sampling of buckets, i.e., Bucket Reuse in nonexclusive experiments, the properties of the difference-in-means estimator of the average treatment effect is approximately equivalent to the properties under random sampling of units.

If things happened during the last D days that make the set of buckets available for sampling at time T different from the population with respect to the treatment effect, the estimator is biased.
